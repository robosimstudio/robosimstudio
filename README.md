RoboSimStudio is an open, interactive GPU simulation toolkit for rebuilding real
robot manipulation tasks in simulation, by hand or with a coding agent.

## Quick start

We provide an [installation guide](https://github.com/robosimstudio/robosimstudio/blob/main/examples/install.md) and comprehensive examples in [`examples/`](https://github.com/robosimstudio/robosimstudio/tree/main/examples) to help you get started quickly. Alternatively, you can use a coding agent such as Codex or Claude Code to create a simulation environment by simply providing the following prompt:

```
Set up environment for https://github.com/robosimstudio/robosimstudio
and create a simulation environment for [Your task instruction]
based on the video at [Your Video Path].
```
